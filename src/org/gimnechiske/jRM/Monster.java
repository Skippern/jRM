 * @author Aun Johnsen
 *
 * Represents beasts and monsters encountered
 * 
 * There should be an easy way to create Monsters as well as a random
 * encounter function.
 * 
 * Monsters can be friends (non-aggressive), allies (aggressive against
 * enemies of players), or foes (aggressive against players)
 * 
 * Monsters should act on basic scripts, though some manipulation from the
 * GM should be possible.
